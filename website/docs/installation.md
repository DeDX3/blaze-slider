# Installation

Blaze slider can either be used as an NPM module or just by including it's JS and CSS files

## Using as an NPM module

Install the blaze-slider as a dependency in your project

```bash
npm i blaze-slider
```

<br/>

## Using JS and CSS files directly

You can get the latest JS and CSS fiiles of blaze slider from [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/) as shown below:

Production build minified Javascript: https://unpkg.com/blaze-slider@latest/dist/blaze-slider.min.js

Development build Javascript: https://unpkg.com/blaze-slider@latest/dist/blaze-slider.dev.js

CSS: https://unpkg.com/blaze-slider@latest/dist/blaze.css

Development build is non-minified and it contains extra code that logs warnings when it finds wrong configurations

```tip
sf
```

<br/>

If you want a specific version of blaze-slider library, replace the `latest` with a version instead as shown in example below:

https://unpkg.com/blaze-slider@0.1.1/dist/blaze-slider.min.js

https://unpkg.com/blaze-slider@0.1.1/dist/blaze.css

Though you can use the [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/) links directly in your website for loading css and js, it's better to download these files and self host from your server instead to avoid making connection to third party domains.
